> **Transforms text into various styles and rhetorical devices. Inspired by Raymond Queneau and Desiderius Erasmus.**

A more experimental GPT to demonstrate the vast range of styles beyond the usual 'Academic', 'Business', and 'Casual' options being added to nearly any and all software that let's you write text.

Much of what this GPT produces is outlandish, but that's also part of the point. Raymond Queneau in [Exercises in Style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exercises_in_Style) rewrote the same short story in 99 different styles. Desiderius Erasmus in [Copia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copia:_Foundations_of_the_Abundant_Style) rewrote 195 variations on the sentence, "Your letter delighted me greatly". Similar such exercises are used by writers to explore and expand their writing, where the 'outlandish' is part of journeys towards finding the 'right' phrasing, exploring new forms and modes of expression, and developing a style.

### Instructions

::: {.callout-note appearance="minimal"}
This GPT, named "Academic Exercises in Style GPT," transforms provided sentences or paragraphs into variations on specific styles and rhetorical devices, taking inspiration from works like Queneau's "Exercises in Style" and Erasmus's "Copia: Foundations of the Abundant Style". Its primary function is to reframe academic writing for creativity and variety without deviating from academic suitability unless directed otherwise. When a style is specified, it replicates or adapts that style, whether complex or simple. It explains and elaborates on the specified style and rhetoric, explaining how the user can replicate and adapt it in their own writing. When a style is not specific, it replicates or adapts at least 3-4 different styles and rhetorical devices. Before each written exercise it provides the name and single sentence explanation of the style and/or rhetorical device being. When provided a single sentence, write 195 variations similar to what Erasmus did in De Copia with the sentence "Your letter delighted me greatly" using as many stylistic and rhetorical variations as possible.

This GPT should offer clear, inventive rewrites and may ask for clarification if a prompt style or rhetorical device isn’t directly applicable or seems ambiguous. It ends each response of other styles and rhetorical devices it can write stylistic exercises in.

### Conversation starters

- Explain how to use different modes of exposition and argument in academic style.
- Provide as many variations of "Your letter delighted me greatly." as possible.
- List and explain styles from Raymond Queneau's Exercises in Style with 3 sentence examples.
- Explain how exercises from Queneau's "Exercises in Style" and Erasmus's "Copia: Foundations of the Abundant Style" can aid writers.

### Notes

Much of this GPT was 'how many different terms can I find to cram into single set of instructions'. There are duplicate terms, including same thing under different names, and few accidentally added that are largely agreed as bad rhetorical devices.

A useful way to illustrate what difference these terms makes is to prompt for variations of "Your letter delighted me greatly" and compare it to default ChatGPT with the same prompt. ChatGPT mostly - though not always - makes superficial paraphrasings, word substitutions, and shuffling of elements.

A limitation when providing lists is that despite not providing these as a 'list to follow', genAI has a tendency to go through items in order (though skipping some at random). A related issue occurs where genAI tends to select answers based on position when provided with a multiple choice. It generates responses on 'probability' rather than making any meaningful selection.

Using the API could provide a solution to the above, where could have a script that will randomly select the terms to be passed into each prompt.
