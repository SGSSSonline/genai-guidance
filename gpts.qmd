### Introduction

::: {.callout-note title="Section Overview"}
This section contains custom GPTs I have setup to demonstrate different genAI use-cases. These GPTs are a mix of ones I have created for students in specific contexts, ones I use myself, and ones to demonstrate what is possible more than what is most useful.

In other words, these GPTs are not setup as exemplars for how you *must* nor *should* use genAI in all cases and contexts. Even where you find any useful, over time you will find that experimenting with your own prompts to customise responses to your specific use-cases is the best option. These GPTs are designed to help build a sense of what is possible and share examples of more complex prompts.

Please note, whilst these GPTs have been setup with ChatGPT you **do not** need to have a paid account to use them. A paid account is required to create custom GPTs, but as with pretty much most paid genAI features this is basically 'convenience' and not 'essential' to have.

At heart a custom GPT is merely a saved reuseable prompt with optional access to certain files pre-setup, alongside other settings. Copying and pasting the instructions into the start of a new chat will effectively recreate the same behaviour.

Indeed, nor is using ChatGPT to set these up in any way an endorsement of ChatGPT itself. The custom GPT feature was merely the easiest way to setup and share such examples. Again, the instructions can be copy and pasted into a new chat - and any custom GPT equivalent - within other genAI tools.

### Explore Own Use-Cases

::: experiment
The full instructions for each GPT is shared to show how it was setup, alongside some 'conversation starters' and general notes on design decisions and limitations. Experiment with tweaking the instructions to tailor them to your use-cases and preferences.

Have a use-case not covered? Skim through the instructions and see if there is anything can adapt and modify to craft prompts for it.
